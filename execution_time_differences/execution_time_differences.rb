# Learning Goals
# Be able to determine the time and space complexity of a method
# Be able to compare the time complexity of one method to another
# Be able to recognize when time or space complexity can be improved


# my_min
# Given a list of integers find the smallest number in the list.

# Example:

#     list = [ 0, 3, 5, 4, -5, 10, 1, 90 ]
#     my_min(list)  # =>  -5
# Phase I
# First, write a function that compares each element to every other element of the list. Return the element if all other elements in the array are larger.
# What is the time complexity for this function?

# Phase II
# Now rewrite the function to iterate through the list just once while keeping track of the minimum. What is the time complexity?
